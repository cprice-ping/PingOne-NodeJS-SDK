# PingOne NodeJS SDK

 Module to support making calls to P1 Services from NodeJS

 This is an attempt to make PingOne calls easier to make.

 Due to the need for a P1 Worker token, these calls need to be be handled from a server-side component - Fastify is used to provide API routes for a demo SPA to use.
